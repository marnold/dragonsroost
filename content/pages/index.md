# Matt Arnold a/k/a Piusbird

Software Engineer, artist, and...

## The Internet's favorite bird person



 In the year 2022 THE INTERNET, and 
THE COMPUTER REVOLUTION have strayed far from the ideals which formed it
Instead of creating a world in which all people could get ahead
Regardless of background, or birth.  Where the free flow of information
would ensure Truth, and Justice would reign supreme.
Global Megacorperations, and cynical opportunists have perverted the systems
that were meant to ensure freedom, opportunity, truth, and unity
into the most powerful system of oppression and division yet known to humanity.
The tools exist to FIGHT BACK, but THE RESISTANCE is disorganized and weak.
Some have even been co-opted by the FORCES OF DARKNESS, only seeing technology
as a means to secure ECONOMIC PROSPERITY.

If the ideals of the revolution are to TRIUMPH, people must see the 
digital world as something more than the corporate services, and 
MARKETPLACE of IDEAS. We must see the digital world as a HOME
so that we may FIGHT to PROTECT IT.

But a house is NO HOME without JOY within it.

Thus my mission 
To Explore Strange and Unfamiliar corners of the the INTERNET
To seek out emerging forms of ART AND EXPRESSION.
To EDUCATE MY FELLOW humans in the Craft of Computing
To Bring Joy and Delight back into our Digital Lives
